		<h2>Barista Pet Peeves</h2>
		  <p>I have been a Barista at Starbucks for 11 months, pushing a year. Similarly, I have <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/barista-pet-peeves/">seen a lot of things</a> that can be annoying or cause some confusion within the baristas so here are a few of mines.</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Ordering your drink all at the same time</li>
			 <p>Many people will say their order really quickly including their modification. When they say it like that, we are bound to get something wrong. This can cause a lot of confusion and sometimes frustration. </p>
			<li>"Accidentally" passing the sound box in a drive thru</li>
			  <p>Technically, we are not allowed to take orders at the window in the drive through. So when someones passes the sound box we have to ask them to circle back around. It also affects the drive thru times and throws off our system.</p>
			<li>Someone yelling at me about a drink I did not make</li>
			  <p>"I understand your drink might have been made incorrectly however, I did not make it. I would be happy to remake it for you the way you would like it." It happens frequently so I have to explain that to them (minus the I did not make it part).</p>
