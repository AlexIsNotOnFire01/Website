		Hi! I'm Alex and this is a little bit of general information about me.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		My favorite color is purple. My favorite movie is <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81043665">Purple Hearts</a>. I love to learn languages, the only language I have
		genuinely stuck to learning has been Spanish and Korean. I just graduated high school last year (2022). I went to
		<a href="https://www.ccsoh.us/EastmoorAcademyHS">Eastmoor Academy</a> for my general education classes and Columbus Downtown High School for my career center. Currently for work, I am a <a href="blogs.html"> Barista</a> part-time at Starbucks.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		<a href="https://www.ccsoh.us/columbusdowntownhs">Columbus Downtown High School</a> is where I got my love for coding and computers. That is also where I finally decided
		what I was going to major in college.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		In the future, I want to be able to travel around the world and live somewhere abroad for a few months. Career-wise, I would like to get a job coding. I had <a href="projects.html">an internship</a> in the past that was technology-based and that is what made me want to have a job dealing with technology and code. I would like for it to be part-time but I think that is bound to change depending on where I am at when I graduate college.
