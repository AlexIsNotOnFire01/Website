	<h2>These are the projects that I am most proud of!</h2>
	  <ol>
		<li>Snake</li>
		  <ul>This is a project I worked on at school and I was so excited to finish it. Since this is a playable game I made, I am the proudest of it.</ul>
		<li><a href="https://centralstate.edu/centerofexcellence/">Central State Use Case</a></li>
		  <ul>This was a project I worked on in my <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/personal/about-us/careers/types/college/">Nationwide Technology internship</a>. I was tasked to come up with a template to help people understand Nationwide's partnership with Central State. I worked in Microsoft and Excel.</ul>
		<li>Rock Paper Scissors </li>
		  <ul>This is another project I worked on when I figured out I wanted to learn to code. I watched a lot of YouTube videos to compile one project.</ul>
